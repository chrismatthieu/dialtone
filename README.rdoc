= Tropo Voice Dialtone

This is a Node.JS-powered Phono (http://phono.com) / Tropo (http://tropo.com) application. Click the Phono button and say or enter a 10 digit number that you would like to dial and we will do the rest.

== How does it work?

Phono is a jQuery based VoIP SIP phone that runs in the browser.  When the red button is clicked, it places a SIP call into a Tropo application using the WebAPI.  The Tropo application is written in Node.JS and uses the Tropo-WebAPI and Express NPM modules.  The Tropo app first asks the caller to say or enter a phone number.  The phone number is posted back to the Tropo app (/answer) where a transfer response is returned to the Tropo cloud.
